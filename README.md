# Description
This project is dedicated to analysis of data from telegram. My biggest interest was in the analysis of the messages themselves, so the graphs and plots mainly show the result of the analysis of different types of messages (voice messages, stickers), the time of sending messages, the frequency of words in messages, etc. I also tried to determine the gender distribution in my telegram as accurately as possible (for this, I first analyzed the names of people, and then their messages to detect their gender).

# How to use
You can use Jupyter notebook to view my analysis of your telegram data.
You will need to download data from telegram using this repo https://github.com/c-cristiiina/telegram-dialogs-analysis-v2 by SanGreel;
Than run file 2_eda.ipynb, but don't forget to change path variables and telegram id.
