# Description
This project is dedicated to analysis of data from telegram. My biggest interest was in the analysis of the messages content and some general data about people. That's why, the graphs and plots mainly show the result of the analysis of different types of messages (voice messages, stickers), mood based on messages, word clouds, reasons of activity on special days, etc. There is still a plenty of different topics to investigate: country of origin of people in telegram, more analysis of private dialogs, investigation of date of birthday based on congratulations in telegram, etc.
